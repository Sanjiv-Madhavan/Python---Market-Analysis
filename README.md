# Python
I will be uploading all the python projects that I do
These include mainly stock market analysis and value investing analysis
Value analysis is formatted to work with the https://www.equitymaster.com/ website where you can find the statements of Indian companies.
Stock analysis is formatted for information available in https://in.finance.yahoo.com/

## Update (7/26/2020) :
I have uploaded the Machine learning for the nifty stock analysis. I have used wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIFTY_50) to get the company lists.
